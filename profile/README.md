**ReWinXP** is a GUI-based installer project for Windows XP, designed to simplify the deployment of XP systems on modern or semi-modern hardware. It runs from a MiniXP RAM-disk environment (e.g. based on Hiren's BootCD) and provides a clean, guided installation experience via `winnt32.exe`, without the need for command-line operations.

## 🚀 Motivation

Despite being discontinued, Windows XP still sees use in retro computing, legacy software environments, embedded systems, and hardware with partial XP support.
However, installing XP today is often:

* frustrating (especially with AHCI/SATA issues),
* reliant on outdated boot media,
* or requires manual, error-prone steps.

**ReWinXP** aims to solve this by offering a graphical, universal installation shell that automates common setup tasks and works from a preboot environment.

## ✨ Key Features

* 🖥️ **WinForms-based GUI wizard** (no batch files or CMD prompts)
* 💾 Runs from **MiniXP** (Hiren's BootCD or similar XP.wim)
* 🧩 Supports **multiple XP distributions** via `deployment/` folder
* 🌍 **Multi-language support** via XML-based manifest system
* 💡 Guided flow: format, select partition, copy files, reboot
* 🚀 Compatible with **AHCI-mode boot**, Ventoy, and USB boot
* 🔒 Minimal shell (can fully replace Explorer shell in MiniXP)
